## Critical Insights

### 1. The Retention Crisis
Only **7% of customers** remain active after 12 months. The steepest drop occurs in the first 60 days—our "make or break" window.

**Action:** Implement 60-day onboarding program with proactive engagement touchpoints.

### 2. The Power Law of Customer Value
**11.5% of customers generate 42% of revenue.** Just 2 customers account for £444K in sales.

**Action:** Deploy VIP account management for high-value segment; personalized service prevents catastrophic losses.

### 3. Discount > BOGO
Discounts outperform BOGO offers by **70%** (7.66% vs 4.52% conversion uplift).

**Action:** Shift promotional budget to discount-first strategy.

### 4. Target the Persuadables
Uplift modeling reveals that targeting the **top 25%** of persuadable customers achieves:
- **2x higher conversion rate**
- **Same revenue from half the audience**
- **50% reduction in marketing waste**
